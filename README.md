##Gameplay
The player takes control of a mechanical robot or "mech" and explores a gravity-controlled environment where they aim to shoot at their opponents with an arsenal of various projectiles. Numerous, destructible planets are available as footholds for the players. The gravity of each planet enacts a force of gravity on their surroundings, causing warping in the trajectories of the projectiles and even the players' movements. 
Playable through local Wi-Fi on Windows, Mac, and Android. Supports up to 4 players.

##Controls

On Android, one can use their left hand on the touch pad to move their mech and their right hand to shoot in the direction of the point of contact. The right hand can also switch between weapons.
On Windows and Mac, users can utilize a mouse between menus. During gameplay, the mouse can also be used to aim and shoot. Also, the following keys are used to play the game. 
* A - Left
* S - Down
* D - Right
* W - Up
