# mech_wreck
A local Wi-fi based multiplayer 2-D shooter based around mechanical players and planets with warping gravities.

#Gameplay
A player takes control of a 'mech' and explores a gravity-controlled environment where they aim to shoot at their opponents with an arsenal of various projectiles. Numerous, destructible planets are availble as footholds for the players. The graivity of each planet enacts a force of gravity on their surroundings, causing warping in the trajectories of the projectiles and even the players' movements.
